                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The water cycle is an important process that everyone and everything will need, so if the water cycle in Malaysia were to get disrupted, or non-functional ; there would be severe impacts towards : economy, peoples well-being, environment, society,and most importantly - our survival.</li>

                <h2>Impact on malaysia</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>When we lack the process of evaporation , we will not receive rain/percipitation - this causes a shortage of water , farmers will be unable to water their crops and we will also start to have a shortage of food too! In addition, this will also cause <i>PANIC</i> among the community.</li>
                    <li>Our crops will be gone, our water will also be gone-sooner or later. The prices of our food will also skyrock high because it's going to be even more harder to find out basic needs. Even the price of normal water will also increase.</li>    
                    <li>Many species that rely on consistent water sources would face extinction or be forced to migrate.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Coping strategies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We can cope to these situations by starting to conserve our precious water.</li>
                    <li>In addition to that, governments can also limit the amount of water used by the community so that the country doesn't run out of water.</li>
                    <li>My last idea is that government can build a place just to conserve water.  </li>
